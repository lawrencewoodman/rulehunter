Rulehunter allows you to describe your goals and will then find simple rules to use on a supplied dataset to meet those goals.

Getting Started
---------------
* Follow the Rulehunter [installation](http://rulehunter.com/docs/installation/) instructions.  There are prebuilt binaries for a number of platforms.
* Look at the [examples](http://rulehunter.com/docs/examples/) to get a feel for how Rulehunter can be used.
* Read about its [configuration](http://rulehunter.com/docs/configuration/) and [usage](http://rulehunter.com/docs/usage/)
* Start creating [experiments](http://rulehunter.com/docs/experiments/)
* See the [Rulehunter](http://rulehunter.com) website for more information

Testing
-------
To make testing simpler under Linux, where root is needed, you can use the following (replace _systemd_ with _upstart_ if using the latter init system):

```Shell
sudo ./linux-test-su.sh $GOPATH `which go` systemd
```

To test the output of the server you can create a simple static webserver using something like the following from the `wwwDir` directory specified in the `config.yaml`:

```Shell
ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000
```

If you don't like ruby there is this [list of one-liner static webservers](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255).
